# SML-Java

[![This project is considered experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-experimental-critical.svg)](https://benknoble.github.io/status/experimental/)

An SML parser built in java using ANTLR 4.

An [SML Grammar](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/sml.html) is reproduced in
[doc/smlgrammar.html]() (with a minor correction: type variables cannot be
empty).
